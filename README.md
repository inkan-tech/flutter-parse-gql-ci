# parse_gql_ci

A Flutter project that aims to provide a simple code/demo to achieve the following:

- Login/Signup/logout state-managed
- parse Back4app backend using GraphQL > 5.0 module
- Tests of the functions
- CI/CD of the tests

## Motivation

Despite looking for an existing example, I could only find outdated ones for GraphQL 3.0.0 with incompatibilities, no complete end to end, especially no tests and CI/CD.

Kudos to <https://github.com/shubie/flutter-thursday-login-registration.git> for the initial code

## How to use this example

The idea is to use environment variables to set access to B4APP to ease CI/CD
